TasteMakers
===========

An app that lets you share, create and check in at different tastes.


_Description_
This app is created as an test project for my internship. I needed to make an app that shows you the nearest restaurants. Because I wanted to do something different I created this app. This app hasn't got any restaurants in the beginning, but will be filled by users. This because users can recommend others where they need to go to. This way, you have a sort of a crowdsourced platform.
